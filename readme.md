# Danny's Skeleton Theme

A simple child theme for PageLines Framework, containing nothing, but the bare bone (no pun intended) files. The idea behind Skeleton is to provide you to have an insanely basic child theme for which you can build upon.

## Sections Directory

One of the cool things about adding a **/sections** directory to your child theme is that, you can override the core sections without having to fear an update wiping your changes.

Want to change how the NavBar functions? Simply copy the **/navbar** directory into your child themes **/sections** directory and edit away.
