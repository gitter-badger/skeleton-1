Info

* You can rename the folder to whatever you like, usually this is your themes name.
* In the style.css file, you will find the following:

/*
Theme Name: Skeleton
Theme URI: http://www.pagelines.com
Description: Skeleton, a basic child theme for PageLines DMS
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Danny Holt
Author URI: https://github.com/Dannyholt/
Template: dms
*/

You can change all info except for `Template: dms` as this tells Wordpress, this theme is a child theme of DMS.

For example:

/*
Theme Name: My Theme Name
Theme URI: http://www.my-website.com
Description: My Themes description goes here...
Version: 6.6.6
Author: My Name goes here
Author URI: http://www.my-website.com
Template: dms
*/
